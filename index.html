        <h2>What is Friendship?</h2>
        <p>Friendship is a bond that is built on trust, respect, and love. It is a relationship where two or more people share common interests, experiences, and emotions. True friendship is about supporting each other in both good and bad times, and it stands the test of time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>True Friendship</h2>
        <p>True friendship goes beyond just sharing fun moments. It is about being there for each other when it matters most. True friends help each other grow, face challenges, and remain loyal through all situations. They trust each other deeply and encourage each other to be their best selves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Trust in Friendship</h2>
        <p>Trust is the foundation of any friendship. Without trust, there is no true bond. When you trust a friend, you believe in them with all your heart, knowing that they will stand by your side no matter what. Trust allows friends to be vulnerable with each other and creates a safe space for honesty and love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Kindness in Friendship</h2>
        <p>Kindness is one of the greatest qualities a friend can offer. True friends are always kind and considerate, not just in words, but in actions. A kind friend listens without judgment, helps without expecting anything in return, and treats you with love and respect. Kindness makes a friendship stronger and more meaningful.</p>
